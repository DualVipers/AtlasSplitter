# Atlas Splitter

This program splits TextureAtlas xml files into multiple images used by many game engines and art/animation tools.

## WARNING

Does not yet support frames. Why? Cause I can't figure out how to make that work with the separated images.

### How to install

With NPM:
`npm install -g atlas-splitter`

With Yarn:
`yarn global add atlas-splitter`
